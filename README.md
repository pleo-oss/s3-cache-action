## Description

Allows to skip a job if it already succeeded for the same repo tree hash. Uses S3 for caching.

<!-- action-docs-description -->

This action works for workflow runs across different branches, which is not currently possible using
[`actions/cache`](https://github.com/actions/cache).' This allows to e.g. safely skip work after
merging to the main branch, if the code was tested/linted/built on a feature branch already.

## How It Works

It saves a `cache/${repoOwner}/${repoName}/${keyPrefix}/${treeHash}` file in an S3 bucket, where
`treeHash` is the current root tree hash of the git repo (i.e. the output of `git rev-parse HEAD:`).
If the GitHub workflow job is ran with the same state of the repository after succeeding once, you
can avoid any work by checking the `processed` output of this action which will be set to `true`.

Since GitHub Actions do not yet support early exits from jobs, you'll need to check the value of the
`processed` output of this action for every step in the job that you want to avoid.

Note that the action assumes that the AWS credentials have already been configured for the job, and
allow to read and write to the S3 bucket provided as input. Use the
`aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials` action in a step prior to running this action to ensure
that's the case.

| bucket-name           | Name of the S3 bucket to use for storing cache files. The job needs to have AWS credentials configured to allow read/write from this bucket.                                | `true`   |                                  |
| key-prefix            | Key prefix to add to the cache files key. By default the job ID is used. The full key used for the cache files is "cache/${repoOwner}/${repoName}/${keyPrefix}/${treeHash}" | `false`  | ${{ github.job }}                |
| aws-region            | AWS region for the S3 bucket used for storing hashes.                                                                                                                       | `false`  | ${{ env.AWS_REGION }}            |
| aws-access-key-id     | AWS Access Key for the AWS account managing the S3 bucket used for storing hashes.                                                                                          | `false`  | ${{ env.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}     |
